# Dark Matter as a Stochastic Resonance of the Quantum Vacuum

> Repository for the manuscript and materials exploring dark matter as an effective, band-limited stochastic response of the quantum vacuum, modeled via a causal, passive susceptibility `chi(omega,k)` (Kramers–Kronig, Im{chi} ≤ 0), without introducing new propagating particles.

## TL;DR

- **Idea:** DM phenomenology emerges from a **stochastic resonance** of the vacuum (memory kernel `chi(omega,k)`), not from a standalone particle.  
- **Math backbone:** in-in (Schwinger–Keldysh) / **Einstein–Langevin** → explicit route to an **effective density** `rho_eff` expanded in a filtered field `zeta_R`.  
- **Stability:** poles in the lower half-plane, spectral positivity, and **off-band** criteria that avoid parametric instabilities.  
- **Falsifiable predictions (active channels):**  
  1) **Weak-lensing trispectrum** (band-limited, folded/parallelogram template)  
  2) **Stochastic GW** bounds `Omega_GW(f)` via a causal kernel `J(f; tau_c)`  
- **2025 nulls integrated:** **Euclid QR1** (no WL 4-pt band), **JWST Bullet** (no offset → `tau_c ≤ 0.10 Myr`), **LVK O4** (tighter SGWB limits). The lab-Hz channel is **removed** (out of band in the allowed regime).
