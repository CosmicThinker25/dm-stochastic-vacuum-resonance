# Dark Matter as a Stochastic Resonance of the Quantum Vacuum

> Repository for the manuscript and materials exploring dark matter as an effective, band-limited stochastic response of the quantum vacuum, modeled via a causal, passive susceptibility `chi(omega,k)` (Kramers–Kronig, Im{chi} ≤ 0), without introducing new propagating particles.

## TL;DR
- **Idea:** DM phenomenology emerges from a stochastic resonance of the vacuum (memory kernel `chi(omega,k)`), not from a standalone particle.  
- **Math backbone:** in-in (Schwinger–Keldysh) / **Einstein–Langevin** → explicit route to an **effective density** `rho_eff`.  
- **Stability:** lower-half-plane poles, spectral positivity, **off-band** criteria.  
- **Falsifiable predictions:** (1) **weak-lensing** trispectrum (band-limited, folded/parallelogram), (2) **stochastic GW** bounds `Omega_GW(f)`.  
- **2025 nulls integrated:** Euclid QR1, JWST Bullet (→ `tau_c ≤ 0.10 Myr`), LVK O4. Lab-Hz channel removed.

## Abstract (short)
We present a falsifiable, effective description of dark matter as a **stochastic resonance** of the quantum vacuum. A **causal, passive** susceptibility `chi(omega,k)` yields an **effective density** `rho_eff` via the in-in/Einstein–Langevin formalism. On/off-band **stability** criteria are derived. 2025 nulls (Euclid QR1, JWST Bullet, LVK O4) are integrated as constraints on `(ell_c, tau_c, f_res)`, removing the lab-Hz prediction (`tau_c ≤ 0.10 Myr`).

## Roadmap
- [x] Full model write-up, stability on/off band  
- [x] Integration of 2025 nulls → priors + constraints  
- [ ] Pipeline-based contours (Euclid/LSST, LVK/NANOGrav)  
- [ ] Data-driven figures
